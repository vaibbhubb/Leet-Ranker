## Problem

Julia just finished conducting a coding contest, and she needs your help assembling the leaderboard! Write a query to print the respective _hacker\_id_ and _name_ of hackers who achieved full scores for *more than one* challenge. Order your output in descending order by the total number of challenges in which the hacker earned a full score. If more than one hacker received full scores in same number of challenges, then sort them by ascending _hacker\_id_.

**Input Format**

The following tables contain contest data:

- _Hackers:_ The _hacker\_id_ is the id of the hacker, and _name_ is the name of the hacker. <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/19504/1458526776-67667350b4-ScreenShot2016-03-21at7.45.59AM.png"/>

- _Difficulty:_ The _difficult\_level_ is the level of difficulty of the challenge,  and _score_ is the maximum score that can be achieved for a challenge at that difficulty level. <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/19504/1458526915-57eb75d9a2-ScreenShot2016-03-21at7.46.09AM.png"/>

- _Challenges:_ The _challenge\_id_ is the id of the challenge, the _hacker\_id_ is the id of the hacker who created the challenge, and _difficulty\_level_ is the level of difficulty of the challenge. <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/19504/1458527032-f9ca650442-ScreenShot2016-03-21at7.46.17AM.png"/>
