## Problem

A *[median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median)* is defined as a number separating the higher half of a data set from the lower half. Query the *median* of the *Northern Latitudes* (*LAT\_N*) from **STATION** and round your answer to $4$ decimal places. 


**Input Format**

The **STATION** table is described as follows:

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/9336/1449345840-5f0a551030-Station.jpg" title="Station.jpg" />

where *LAT\_N* is the northern latitude and *LONG\_W* is the western longitude.

FROM (
    SELECT 
        LAT_N,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY LAT_N) AS rn,
        COUNT(*) OVER () AS N
    FROM STATION
) AS T
WHERE rn IN (FLOOR((N+1)/2), CEIL((N+1)/2))
